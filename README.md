# Spirit of Metal

Spirit of Metal (SOM) is a collaborative webzine and encyclopedia about Metal music. It has lots of editorial resources like news, reviews or interviews, as well as a rich wiki that references bands, albums, and so on...

This website was created by Kivan in 2003 and did not change so much since then. Given that the Web is moving fast and that the audience has grown dramatically over the years, SOM now reaches the point where change is unescapable.

This repository is here to refresh the SOM ecosystem with new technical projects.
